# Unicafe application
Like most companies, Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad. The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category.

Note that the application needs to work only during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.
